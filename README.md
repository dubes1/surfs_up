## Purpose of the Analysis  
To provide climate analysis for a beach in Hawaii to see if it is a smart investment to open up an ice cream shack  
## Results  
* The mean temperature in June is almost 75 degrees which is an ideal temperature for selling ice cream  
* Even December typically one of the colder months of the year has an average of 71 degrees and even the lowest quartile the temperature is 69 degrees for December which would suggest that this is an ideal location to open up an ice cream shack because it can be open year round while most ice cream shacks are seasonal businesses  
* The standard deviation is 3 degrees both in December and in June which suggests that the temperature is pretty stable

## Summary  
It would seem like a smart investment to make to open an ice cream shack on this beach as evidenced by the warm climate year round. An additional 2 factors i would look into is the humidity percentage year round to track precipitation and rainfall to see if there are a lot of rainy days which would deter. Another factor i looked into is the difference between June 2010 and June 2017 to track if the island is getting hotter and if that would continue trending up to see if the island would start getting too hot and found that the average temperature rose over 2 degrees which could be worrisome for the future
